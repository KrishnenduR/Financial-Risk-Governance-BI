# Integrated BI and Predictive Modeling for Cross-Dimensional Financial Risk Governance

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive financial risk governance platform that integrates Business Intelligence (BI) analytics with advanced predictive modeling capabilities. The system enables cross-dimensional risk assessment, regulatory compliance monitoring, and strategic decision-making support for financial institutions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional Risk Analytics**: Real-time risk assessment across credit, market, operational, and liquidity dimensions
- **Predictive Modeling Engine**: Machine learning models for risk forecasting and scenario analysis
- **Interactive BI Dashboards**: Dynamic visualizations for risk metrics and KPIs
- **Governance Framework**: Automated compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Data Integration**: ETL pipelines for diverse financial data sources
- **Alert System**: Proactive risk threshold monitoring and notifications
